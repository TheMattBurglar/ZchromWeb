This is a Web version of my Zchrom CLI app. It is a program to test what would happen if we added a Z chromosome that made a person Female, regardless of their other chromosome. ex: a ZY Female

I wanted to make it a web app so I could demonstrate it to people and let them try it out without having to install anything.  

Please note that this is significantly slower than either the CLI or the GUI desktop app.  It's doing all the calculations in the browser using JavaScript, while the desktop app and CLI are using Go.  If you want to run this simulation with larger populations or more generations, I recommend using the CLI or GUI desktop app.

And like the GUI app, AI was used in it's creation.  I'm not sure if I'm going to keep adding that caveat to the descriptions of future projects.  At this point, I think AI assisted development is just a fact of life.
